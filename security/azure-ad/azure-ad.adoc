= Azure AD

== Configure Azure

[IMPORTANT]
====
We will be using `https://cloudbees-core.example.com` as the example url for CloudBees Core.
Please replace the domain to your actual domain in all the examples!
====

=== Steps to execute

We will have to do the following steps on Azure side.

* create the Azure Active Directory
* create users / groups
* create App Registration
    * url: `https://cloudbees-core.example.com/cjoc/securityRealm/finishLogin`
    * replace `example.com` with your domain, and change protocol if you're not using https (https is recommended)
* update manifest (for groups) 
    * change: `"groupMembershipClaims": null,` (usually line 11)
    * to: `"groupMembershipClaims": "SecurityGroup",`
* create SP ID / App ID URI
* grant admin consent

[NOTE]
====
If you're going to use the Azure AD plugin, you also create a client secret.
====

=== Information To Note Down

The following information will be unique to your installation, so you need to record them as you go along.

* App ID URI
* Object ID's of Users and Groups you want to give rights
* `Federation Metadata Document` Endpoint
    * Azure AD -> App Registrations -> <your app registration> -> Endpoints (circular icon on top)
    * you can use either the URL or the document contents
    * make sure the URL contains the Tenant ID of your Azure Active Directory
    * URL example: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/${TENANT_ID}/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml`
    * You can find your Tenant ID in `Azure Active Directory` -> `Properties` -> `Directory ID` (different name, same ID)

=== Visual Guide

Below will be a visual guide with screenshots.

There will be hints in the screenshots where you should pay attention to.

* red: this is the main thing
* orange: this is how we got to the current page/view
* blue: while you're in this screen, there might be other things you could do

==== Create New App Registration

If you have an Azure account, you will have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) pre-created.

This guide assumes you have an Azure AD ready to use.

That means, the next step is to create an Application Registration.

image::images/azure-ad-azure-new-app-reg.png[align="center"]

Give the registration a useful name, select who can authenticate and the redirect URL.

This URL needs to be configured and MUST be the actual URL of your CloudBees Core installation.

image::images/azure-ad-azure-new-app-reg2.png[align="center"]

==== App Reg Data

Depending on the plugin you're going to use (SAML or Azure AD) you need information from your Azure AD / App Registration.

* Tentant ID
* Object ID
* Client ID
* Federation Metadata Document (you can use the document or the URL, up to you)

image::images/azure-ad-azure-data2.png[align="center"]

Click on the `Endpoints` button to open the side-bar with the links.

image::images/azure-ad-azure-data1.png[align="center"]

==== App ID

We need the App ID - even if the SAML plugin doesn't mention it.

You can let Azure generate one for you, but as CloudBees Core has a nice URL (which is the type required),
you can also use that as the application URL, eg

[NOTE]
====
App ID must match in both Azure AD (set as "App ID URI") and the SAML plugin (set as "Entity ID")
====


image::images/azure-ad-azure-app-id1.png[align="center"]

This is the generated API URI. But you can replace it with your installation's URL.
Just remember to note this URI down, we will need this when we configure Jenkins.

image::images/azure-ad-azure-app-id2.png[align="center"]

==== API Permissions

Of course, things wouldn't be proper IAM/LDAP/AD without giving some permissions.

If we want to retrieve group information and other fields, we need to be able to read the Directory information.

image::images/azure-ad-azure-api-perm1.png[align="center"]

The Directory information can be found via the `Microsoft Graph` api/button.

image::images/azure-ad-azure-api-perm2.png[align="center"]

We select `Application Permissions` and then check `Directory.Read.All`. We don't need to write.

image::images/azure-ad-azure-api-perm3.png[align="center"]

The Permissions have changed, so we require an Administrator account to consent with the new permissions.

[NOTE]
====
To those working with the CloudBees Azure subscription from PS.
No, we as PS cannot consent this. 

So either we need someone else to do this for us, or you have to use your own Azure Account's Azure AD.
====

image::images/azure-ad-azure-api-perm4.png[align="center"]

==== Update Manifest

As with the permissions, the default `Manifest` doesn't give us all the information we want.

We want the groups, so we can configure RBAC, and thus we have to set the `groupMembershipsClaims` claim attribute.

image::images/azure-ad-azure-manifest1.png[align="center"]

We change the `null` to `"SecurityGroup"`, please consult the Microsoft docs (see reference below) for other options.

We can download, edit and upload the manifest file. Or, we can edit inline and hit save on top.

image::images/azure-ad-azure-manifest2.png[align="center"]

==== Retrieve Group Object ID

If we want to assign Azure AD groups to groups or roles in Jenkins' RBAC, we need to use Object ID's.

Each Group and User will have an `Object ID`, which should have a handy `Copy this` button!

image::images/azure-ad-azure-group-info.png[align="center"]

== Configure Jenkins

=== Steps

* link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/saml[install the SAML plugin]
** I assume you know how to install plugins, so we skip this
** if you don't know link:https://go.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-documentation/admin-instance/managing-plugins/[Read the Managing Plugins Guide]
* configure saml2.0 in Jenkins
* setup groups (RBAC)
** administrators -> admin group
** browsers -> all other groups

=== Visual Guide

Below will be a visual guide with screenshots.

==== Configure Security

To go to Jenkins' security configuration, follow this route:

* login with the current Admin user
* go to the Operations Center
* Manage Jenkins -> Global Security Configuration

===== Configure RBAC

The SAML plugin configuration will pollute the screen with fields.

My advice, enable RBAC first.

If you haven't got any groups/roles yet, I recommend using the `Typical Initial Setup` from the dropdown.

image::images/azure-ad-jenkins-sec1-config.png[align="center"]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure you know the credentials of the current admin user.

It will automatically be added to the `Administrators` group, and it will be your go-to account when you mess up the SAML configuration and you have to reset security. 

For how to reset the security configuration, see the `For When You Mess Up` paragraph.
====

===== Configure SAML

Select `SAML 2.0` from the `Security Realm` options.

Here we need to first supply our `Federation Metadata Document` or it's URL.

Each has its own `Validate ...` button, hit it and confirm it says `Success`.

image::images/azure-ad-jenkins-sec2-config.png[align="center"]

image::images/azure-ad-jenkins-sec5-config.png[align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
You can leave `Displayname` empty, which will give you the default naming scheme from Azure AD.

I think this is fugly, as it amounts to something like `${EMAIL_ADDRESS}_${AD_DOMAIN}_${AZURE_CORP_DOMAIN}`.

There are other options, I've settled for `givenname`, as it there isn't a `fullname` by default, and well, I prefer `Joost` to some weird long string.
====

* Displayname: `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname`
* Group: `http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/groups`
* Username: `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name`
* Email: `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress`

==== Configure RBAC Groups

[TIP]
====
Once Azure AD is configured and it works, you can configure groups for RBAC just as you're used to.

Both for classic RBAC and Team Masters.

Just make sure you use the Azure AD `Object ID`'s of the groups to map them.

Bonus tip, add every Azure AD group to `Browsers`, so you can directly map their groups to Team Master roles without problems.

==== XML Config

[source,xml]
----
  <useSecurity>true</useSecurity>
  <authorizationStrategy class="nectar.plugins.rbac.strategy.RoleMatrixAuthorizationStrategyImpl"/>
 <securityRealm class="org.jenkinsci.plugins.saml.SamlSecurityRealm" plugin="saml@1.1.2">

      <period>5</period>
    </idpMetadataConfiguration>
  </securityRealm>
  <disableRememberMe>false</disableRememberMe>
----

=== Logout URL
Depending on the requirements, you may want to specify a logout url in the SAML configuration
to log you completely out of SAML, not just Core.

An example `https://login.windows.net/<tenant_id_of_your_app>/oauth2/logout?post_logout_redirect_uri=<logout_URL_of_your_app>/logout`



=== For When You Mess Up

This is the default config for security in Core Modern.

[source,xml]
----
 <useSecurity>true</useSecurity>
  <authorizationStrategy class="hudson.security.FullControlOnceLoggedInAuthorizationStrategy">
    <denyAnonymousReadAccess>true</denyAnonymousReadAccess>
  </authorizationStrategy>
  <securityRealm class="hudson.security.HudsonPrivateSecurityRealm">
    <disableSignup>true</disableSignup>
    <enableCaptcha>false</enableCaptcha>
  </securityRealm>
  <disableRememberMe>false</disableRememberMe>
----

To rectify a failed configuration, execute the following steps:

1. exec into the `cjoc-0` container: `kubectl exec -ti cjoc-0 -- bash`
1. open `config.xml`: ` vi /var/jenkins_home/config.xml`
1. replace conflicting lines with the above snippet
1. save the changes
1. exit the container: `exit`
1. kill the pod: `kubectl delete po cjoc-0`

[TIP]
====
For removing a whole line, stay in "normal" mode, and press `d d`.
To add the new lines, go into insert mode by pressing `i`.
Go back to "normal" mode by pressing `esc`.
And then save and quit, by writing: `:wq` followed by `enter`.

[NOTE]
====
The mapping of the object if to groups within is less than ideal visaually, this is
however a limitation of this solution currently. When the Alternative Azure AD Plugin is approved this may provide a more
 satisfactory solution.
